    "question": "hi what are acids and bases??",
    "answer": "Acids are substances that can donate protons (H+) in a chemical reaction, while bases are substances that can accept protons. They are fundamental concepts in chemistry, often defined by the pH scale, where acids have a pH less than 7 and bases have a pH greater than 7. Acids typically have a sour taste and can be found in substances like vinegar and citrus fruits, whereas bases usually have a bitter taste and feel slippery, like soap. The interaction between acids and bases can lead to neutralization, producing water and a salt, which is an important reaction in various chemical processes.",
